1. INTRODUCTION
----------------
This codebook provides the details on the variables, data, and work performed in the "TidyDataset" dataset.
The dataset is the result of a number of transformations to the experiment data from «Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set».
Information from the experiment:

Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012"

   1.3. Original data -> https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

This work is performed as part of the requirements found in Coursera's «Getting and Cleaning Data» course project.
----------------
2. OBJECTIVE
----------------
The objective of the project is to present the experiment data in a format suitable for further analysis.
This is based on the principles of tidy data outlined in Hadley Wickham's paper «Tidy data»	-> https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10
Mainly, this entails the following items:
	2.1. Each variable forms a column
	2.2. Each observation forms a row
	2.3. Each type of observational unit forms a table

As such, a description on the original data is provided below, then the information on the transformations performed is provided, 
and finally a list of all the variables available in the new tidy dataset.
-----------------------------
3. ORIGINAL DATA DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------
The original data was presented as follows:
	3.1. "Test" directory 
		3.1.1. Raw data obtained directly from experiment, all under the "Inertial signals" folder (i.e. "body_acc_x_test.txt", "body_acc_y_test.txt", "body_acc_z_test.txt", "body_gyro_x_test.txt", "body_gyro_y_test.txt", "body_gyro_z_test.txt", "total_acc_x_test.txt", "total_acc_y_test.txt", "total_acc_z_test.txt") 
		3.1.2. Subject Ids for the experiment volunteers (i.e. "subject_test.txt")
		3.1.3. Activity Ids for the different experiment activities performed (i.e. "y_test.txt")
		3.1.4. Values obtained in the experiment (i.e. "X_test.txt")
	
	3.2. "Train" directory
		3.2.1. Raw data obtained directly from experiment, all under the "Inertial signals" folder (i.e. "body_acc_x_train.txt", "body_acc_y_train.txt", "body_acc_z_train.txt", "body_gyro_x_train.txt", "body_gyro_y_train.txt", "body_gyro_z_train.txt", "total_acc_x_train.txt", "total_acc_y_train.txt", "total_acc_z_train.txt") 
		3.2.2. Subject Ids for the experiment volunteers (i.e. "subject_train.txt")
		3.2.3. Activity Ids for the different experiment activities performed (i.e. "y_train.txt")
		3.2.4. Values obtained in the experiment (i.e. "X_test.txt")
	
	3.3. Labels of the experiment activities (i.e. "activity_labels.txt")
	
	3.4. Information on the transformations and calculations applied on the raw experiment data (i.e. "features_info.txt")
			
	3.5. Variables available in the datasets of the experiment (i.e. "features.txt")
		
NOTES. 
The variables are a result of the following process: [raw signals] --> [converted signals] --> [calculated variables]
That is, the raw data from the experiment was converted through a series of procedures (full details on the "features_info.txt", found in https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
For every converted signals, a number of calculations were performed (independently), resulting in 561 variables presented in the "test" and "train" datasets.
Also, values were normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
-----------------------------
4. TIDY DATA DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------
The data detailed in the previous section was transformed as follows:
	4.1. Subject IDs, activity Ids, and values were column-bound for both the testing data, and the training data
	4.2. The resulting "testing dataset" and "training dataset" were row-bound
	4.3. Of the obtained merged dataset, only variables resulting from "mean()" and "standard_deviation()" calculations were kept
	4.4. For the variable containing the experiment's activities' IDs as integers, these were substituted for character string IDs
	4.5. For all variables, new nomenclature was implemented, as per the following details:
		
		OLD NOMENCLATURE -> [t/f][converted signal]-[calculation] -(X/Y/Z)
			i. "[]" symbols indicate a text string which applies for all variables
			ii. "()" symbols indicate a text string which only applies for some variables
			iii. "/" indicates "OR", meaning that one of the options between "[]" or "()" will apply
			iv. "-" is meant to separate the "converted signal" being used , or it can also indicate the axis (X/Y/Z) in a 3-axial variable (if applicable)
			v. Examples:
				-> tBodyAcc-mean()-X
				-> tBodyAcc-std()-X
				-> fBodyAccMag-mean()
				-> fBodyAccMag-std()

		NEW NOMENCLATURE -> [time/freq].[converted signal].(AxisX/AxisY/AxisZ).[calculation]
			i. "[]" symbols indicate a text string that appears for all variables
			ii. "()" symbols indicate a text string which only applies for some variables
			iii. "/" indicates "OR", meaning that one of the options between "[]" or "()" will apply 
			iv. "." separates text strings
			v. Examples (same as those of old nomenclature above):
				-> Time.BodyAcc.AxisX.Mean
				-> Time.BodyAcc.AxisX.Std
				-> Freq.BodyAccMag.Mean
				-> Freq.BodyAccMag.Std

		NOTE. This does not apply to the first two columns, namely "subjectID" and "activityID".
		
	4.6. A second, independent dataset was created, via:
		4.6.1. Grouping data by subjectID and activityID
		4.6.2. Summarizing the data by collapsing all matching {subject,activity} observations into one observation by calculating the "mean()" function
		4.6.3. Adding the suffix ".SummaryAvg" to all variables (with the exception of "subjectID" and "activityID")
		
-----------------------------------
5. VARIABLES' DESCRIPTION AND LIST
-----------------------------------
As previously mentioned, all variables were obtained from the experiment data from «Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set».
Full details on those variables is available in the "features_info.txt" (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
The process, as aforementioned, was:

	5.1. ORIGINAL DATA
    5.1.1. Raw signals - signals obtained directly from experiments (via accelorometer + gyroscope in smartphones worn by experiment subjects) 
    5.1.2. Converted signals:
        i. 'Acceleration' signal split into 'body' and 'gravity acceleration' signals (e.g. tBodyAcc-XYZ, tGravityAcc-XYZ)
        ii. 'Body-linear acceleration' and 'angular velocity' derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (e.g. tBodyAccJerk-XYZ, tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ)
        iii. Magnitude of the aforementioned calculated via Euclidean norm (e.g. tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag)
        iv. Fast Fourier Transform applied to some of the previously mentioned to obtain: fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag

	5.1.3. Calculated variables - these were estimated based on the previously converted signals, by using the following calculations:
		   Mean, standard deviation, median absolute deviation, largest value, smallest value, signal magnitude area, among several others.

	In summary, there are 561 variables which are obtained by applying all the calculations in step 5.1.3 to all the converted signals obtained in 5.1.2.

	5.2. TIDY DATA
	Of the data described in section 5.1, only variables related to calculation of either mean() or standard_deviation() (abbreviated "sd()"), were retained.
	This results in 68 variables ("subjectID", "activityID", and 66 other variables).
	Also, these variables were renamed as detailed in steps 4.5 and 4.6.3.
	
		5.2.1 Variables' list
			1. subjectID: Integer, ranges from 1:30 for every volunteer in the experiment, who performs the activities.
			2. activityID: Character, possible values {"WALKING","WALKING_UPSTAIRS","WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS","SITTING","STANDING","LAYING"}
				
			All following variables are numerical, and in the range [-1,1] due to original data having been normalized.
