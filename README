The goal of this work is to present a tidy dataset as a result of a number of transformations to the experiment data from «Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set».

   1.3. Original data -> https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
This work is performed as part of the requirements found in Coursera's «Getting and Cleaning Data» course project.

The objective of this work is to present the experiment data in a format suitable for further analysis.
This is based on the principles of tidy data outlined in Hadley Wickham's paper «Tidy data»	-> https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10
Mainly, this entails the following items:
	2.1. Each variable forms a column
	2.2. Each observation forms a row
	2.3. Each type of observational unit forms a table

A full description on the original data, the tidy data, and the work involved is provided in the codebook:
